Kanyakumari is one of the smallest, yet most beautiful coastal towns on the southern tip of India. Kanyakumari was called Cape Comorin by the British, probably as the area is a Cape and the anglicized version was far easier to pronounce.

Kanyakumari, which had been ruled by the Kings of Travancore in Kerala, was later merged with Tamil Nadu as per the Indian States Reorganization Act of 1956. Kanyakumari District has four Taluks, viz- Agasteeswaram, Thovalai, Kalkulam and Vilavankode. Every taluk has its own tourist treasures that would be worthy of a trip.

Mahendragiri and Agasthiyarkudam peaks of the Western Ghats and the Agasthiarmalai and Maruthuvamalai hills add to the charm of the region, along with lush streams, waterfalls, dense virgin forests and the beaches that make Kanyakumari one of the hottest tourism zones of South India, not the mention the spectacle of the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea converging with the Indian Ocean, topped by an amazing vision of the sun setting beyond the waters! There are ancient temples and monuments too, that are bound to keep pilgrims and history buffs happy. If you would like to visit Kanyakumari, our travel guide will help you plan a memorable trip.
