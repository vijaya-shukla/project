Take Kipling at his word and visit Lake Pichola when in Udaipur, both in the day and at night. the lake takes on a whole new character depending on the time of the day. In the morning, lake and palaces are quiet. The lake is speckled with tourist boats and people clicking selfies line the shores. As night creeps in, all the Palaces around the lake light up and illuminate the lake. No boats, no birds, nothing to see except the lit-up palaces as they stand impressively around the lake. It is an awe-imposing spectacle.

The iconic sites around the lake include Udaipur City Palace, Mohan Mandir, Eklinggarh Fort, Jag Mandir, Pichola Palace etc. The Sitamata Game Sanctuary is located on its western shore.
