          The Vast Desert{" "}
            <span className="text-danger">Rann Utsav</span>
          </h2>
          <p>
          My friends and I decided for an annual trip to Rann Utsav.We stayed last year in tent city and entire experience was wonderful. Every tent has good interiors and furnish with good flooring with tiles. That felt like our Home.

Rann Utsav is a celebration of a multiple things and also they provide a multiple option for a stay. If you like a kutchchi culture and theme then you can choose Rajwadi tent which has a fully Rajwadi interior.

If you like white desert with a beautiful view like open sky and full moon then you can choose a tent over there. We were staying there one night and that was one of the amazing experience.

We were staying second night at the tent city, Dhordo. It is a place where entire celebration right in front of your eyes and we enjoyed a lot with this view. And the tents are very high in a cost but they provide best and luxurious services. And we felt a very comfort like a Home.

Kutch is famous for its Traditional, Heritage & Culture. Pl. stay at Traditional Mud Hut , Hodaka Village. In village where you will meet lot of artisits who makes handicrafts. Avoid to stay near white Rann because it is too crows and have to follow their schedules. Like you can go at rann at their specific time . You can have pure Kutchchi foods Bajara-no-rotalo , Kadhi, butter milk. Khichadi, Tepala are just not only delicious but healthy also. I make simple following suggestion:

Stay at Traditional Bhunga.Hodaka Village,

Eat origional Kutchchi foods,

Buy traditional handicrafts from inside villages,

Enjoy Jodiya Pava Musics,

Dholavira Herrapan Civilization site must on your itinerary,

Ind0-Pak Border is also important,

Beach & temples, forts, Budhist caves, Forts, palaces all are here,

Vandematram, Heeralaxmi park where light and sound show performed at evening,

Enjoy village life at Bhujpur.

          River Rafting{" "}
            <span className="text-danger">Rishikesh</span>
          </h2>
          <p>
          In one word, I can say it's ``AWESOME’’. It's a must do adventure sport in Rishikesh. You will get that scenic view that you really can't express in words. The adventurous rapids fills you up with an Adrenaline rush! A raft is usually occupied by 7–8 people and one guide. Rafting is not really dangerous but you have to follow the instructions of the guide properly. It's literally Thrilling and Exciting . One should definitely enjoy this thrill seeking activity.
